README â€” Deploy instructions (use the name GURETENCOGURSERVICE in URLs)

Files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- garage-bg.jpg  (background image)
- business-card.jpg (the business card photo)

Quick deploy options (choose one):

1) GitHub Pages (recommended for free static hosting, URL format:
   https://<your-github-username>.github.io/GURETENCOGURSERVICE )

Steps:
- Create a GitHub repo named exactly: GURETENCOGURSERVICE
- Upload all files from this zip to the repository root (index.html at root).
- In repo Settings -> Pages (or 'Pages' in left menu), set source to 'main' branch and root folder (/).
- Wait a few minutes. Your site will be available at:
   https://<your-github-username>.github.io/GURETENCOGURSERVICE
- If your username is 'octavian' the URL will be:
   https://octavian.github.io/GURETENCOGURSERVICE

2) Netlify (quick drag & drop)
- Go to netlify.com, signup/login.
- In Netlify dashboard, choose 'Sites' -> 'New site from Git' (connect repo) OR simply drag-and-drop the folder (build) to the 'Sites' area.
- You can rename the site to "GURETENCOGURSERVICE" inside Netlify settings so the auto-link contains that name:
  https://GURETENCOGURSERVICE.netlify.app  (availability depends on Netlify name availability)

3) Vercel
- Create a new Vercel project from Git (repo name could be GURETENCOGURSERVICE). Vercel will provide a URL like:
  https://guretencogurservice.vercel.app  (or similar). You can set a custom domain later.

Notes:
- If you want the exact path with uppercase letters in GitHub Pages, URL is case-insensitive. Stick to the repo name GURETENCOGURSERVICE.
- I included the images so the site is ready to upload as-is.
